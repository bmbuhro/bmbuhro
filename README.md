Hi There!

🚀 About Me
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🎓 I'm currently pursuing a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science at The University of Hawai'i at Manoa. My expected graduation date is Spring 2027. My goal with this degree is to work as a SWE in Formula1. 

🎸 Outside of working towards my CS degree I enjoy working on cars, hanging out with my friends, and listening to music. I also enjoy hiking and scuba diving. 

👩‍💻 I have been involved in the tech community my whole life. I was a Girl Scout for 12 years where I participated in coding and robotics camps. As well as tutoring people in my CS classes in high school and college.
